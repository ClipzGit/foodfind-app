## What is FoodFind? 
FoodFind is a web-application built in Python using Flask. This application allows anybody to search for recipes using their Ingredients. 
The application uses the **Edamam API** for Recipe Searching. 

## What is next for FoodFind? 
Currently a Custom API for this will be developed without using the **Edamam API**.
